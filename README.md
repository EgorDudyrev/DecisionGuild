There is no paper dedicated specifically for DecisionGuild package (yet). However, we would appreciate if you cite the third paper _"Description Quivers for Compact Representation of Concept Lattices and Ensembles of Decision Trees"_ in your publications. Currently, this paper present the most complete description of the approach used in the package.
